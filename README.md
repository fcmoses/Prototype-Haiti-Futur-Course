# Prototype-Haiti-Futur-Course
Prototype Haiti Futur course implemented in Unity

This is a proof of concept exercise.  No attempt was made to write clean, documented, high performance code.  The graphics approximate the LiveCode course used as its basis, but the scaling, type fonts and sizes, colors, etc. were chosen for convenience and do not follow any formal specifications.
DO NOT USE THIS AS A MODEL FOR PRODUCTION COURSES.  SUBSEQUENT REPOSITORIES WILL BE CREATED AS MODELS FOR COURSES GOING FORWARD.
